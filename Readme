# Introduction
The OpenAI Jupyter Notes repository is designed to provide an in-depth understanding of OpenAI's models through hands-on coding. With a focus on practicality, each notebook offers comprehensive insights into specific models and demonstrates their functionalities using interactive examples. Whether you are a developer or researcher, these notebooks will help you unlock the full potential of OpenAI's models.

# Notebook Structure
The repository follows a well-organized structure to facilitate easy navigation and exploration of the notebooks. Each model or group of related models is housed within its dedicated directory. Within these directories, you will find Jupyter notebook files (*.ipynb) that cover various aspects of the models, including initialization, input formatting, result interpretation, and more.

The notebooks follow a step-by-step approach, guiding you through the entire process of working with the models. Detailed comments, explanations, and markdown sections accompany each code cell to provide a comprehensive learning experience.
