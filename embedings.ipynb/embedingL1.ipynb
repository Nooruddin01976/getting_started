By representing text inputs as vectors, various natural language processing tasks can be performed more effectively. For example, embeddings can be used for search engines to rank search results based on their relevance to a query. They can also be used for clustering, where similar text inputs are grouped together, or for recommendation systems to suggest items with related descriptions"
